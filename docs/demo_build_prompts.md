## ðŸš€ Quick Execution Checklist

Use this checklist to track your progress:

- [ ] **Phase 1 Complete** - Project structure and Git setup
- [ ] **Phase 2 Complete** - All Terraform modules working
- [ ] **Phase 3 Complete** - .NET application running locally
- [ ] **Phase 4 Complete** - CI/CD pipelines configured
- [ ] **Phase 5 Complete** - Documentation finished
- [ ] **Phase 6 Complete** - Everything tested and validated
- [ ] **Phase 7 Complete** - Demo script rehearsed

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips for Tomorrow

1. **Start with Phase 1-2** - Get infrastructure working first
2. **Test frequently** - Validate each phase before moving on
3. **Use the provided artifacts** - We've already created much of this
4. **Focus on core demo** - Skip optional features if running short on time
5. **Rehearse once** - Do a full run-through before the actual demo

## ðŸ†˜ Emergency Shortcuts

If you're running out of time:

1. **Use provided artifacts** - Much of the code is already created above
2. **Focus on dev environment only** - Skip staging/prod for initial demo
3. **Pre-deploy infrastructure** - Have it ready before the demo
4. **Use screenshots** - For any failing components during live demo

Good luck with your demo tomorrow! ðŸŽ‰
